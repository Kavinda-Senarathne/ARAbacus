# ARAbacus
Augmented Reality  based ABACUS 
Itâ€™s a mobile application target on primary grade kids, which can identify the math problem (addition or subtraction) and give the ability to do the problem using Abacus. Here Abacus is AR computer generated image. There are different levels based on the difficulty of the math
problem. Kids get points for every successfully completed level. At the end of the month they can redeem the points and get offers to buy
sweets according to the points they get. We can assign a company to get sponsorships for the sweets for the kids
